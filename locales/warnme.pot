"Warn me is a program to set timed desktop notifications.  It may be used from\n"
"the command line if the POSIX 'at' and the freedesktop.org 'notify-send'\n"
"utilities are available.  If not or if you prefer to use a graphical interface\n"
"the program may be used that way with no other dependencies except Python 3\n"
"with Tkinter module.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Graphical User Interface\n"
"========================\n"
"\n"
"The program's graphical user interface may be launched in the following ways:\n"
"\n"
"* Launch the 'gwarnme.py' program;\n"
"* Launch the 'warnme.py' program with the '--gui' option;\n"
"* Trying to use the 'warnme.py' program in a system without either the POSIX\n"
"  'at' or the freedesktop.org 'notify-send' utilities.\n"
"\n"
"You may set an alarm in one of these ways:\n"
"\n"
"* Set alarm to fire in a specified interval in minutes:\n"
"  - click \"Set alarm in\"\n"
"  - choose the number of minutes\n"
"  - type the desired alarm notification message\n"
"  - if you wish, set the recurrence interval of the alarm, in minutes\n"
"  - press \"Set alarm\" button\n"
"\n"
"* Set alarm to fire at specified time:\n"
"  - click \"Set alarm at\"\n"
"  - choose the hour and minute\n"
"  - type the desired alarm notification message\n"
"  - if you wish, set the recurrence interval of the alarm, in minutes\n"
"  - press \"Set Alarm\" button\n"
"\n"
"To remove an alarm, select it on the list of pending alarms and press the\n"
"\"Remove alarm\" button.  You may select several alarms simultaneously.\n"
"\n"
"All notifications will be lost if you close the program.\n"
"\n"
"Command Line Interface\n"
"======================\n"
"\n"
"Command line interface (terminal) accepted commands and syntax:\n"
"\n"
"* Set alarm at specified interval in minutes:\n"
"  warnme.py --in <minutes> [--text <message>]\n"
"\n"
"* Set alarm at specific time:\n"
"  warnme.py --at <hour:minute> [--text <message>]\n"
"\n"
"* For each of the previous commands, you may also set the recurrence of the\n"
"  alarms, in minutes:\n"
"  warnme.py --in <minutes> [--text <message>] --repeat <minutes>\n"
"  warnme.py --at <hour:minute> [--text <message>] --repeat <minutes>\n"
"\n"
"* Show list of alarm IDs and descriptions:\n"
"  warnme.py --list\n"
"  \n"
"* Remove alarm identified by alarm ID:\n"
"  warnme.py --delete <alarm ID>\n"
"\n"
"* Start the graphical user interface:\n"
"  warnme.py --gui\n"
"\n"
"* Print Help, Warranty, Copyright and version information on the terminal:\n"
"  warnme.py --help\n"
"  warnme.py --warranty\n"
"  warnme.py --copyright\n"
"  warnme.py --version\n"
"  \n"
"* Test notification interface:\n"
