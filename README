ABOUT THE PROGRAM
-----------------

This is a simple alarm notifier to be used from the terminal window
that uses freedesktop.org `notify-send` to alert users of timed events
set by POSIX utility `at`.

If any of those utilities are not available the program will launch
a simple graphical interface (GUI) and use Python Timer to set the
notification events.  This interface may also be used, at the user
option, even if `at` and `notify-send` are available.

Depends on [Python 3.3+](https://www.python.org/). GUI uses
[Python Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
