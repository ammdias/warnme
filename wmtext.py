The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Warn me

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;  for details use command
'warnme.py --warranty' or go to 'Help > Warranty' on the graphical user
interface.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; use command 'warnme.py --copyright' or go to 'Help > Copyright' on
the graphical user interface for details.

----

Warn me is a program to set timed desktop notifications.  It may be used from
the command line if the POSIX 'at' and the freedesktop.org 'notify-send'
utilities are available.  If not or if you prefer to use a graphical interface
the program may be used that way with no other dependencies except Python 3
with Tkinter module.


Graphical User Interface
========================

The program's graphical user interface may be launched in the following ways:

* Launch the 'gwarnme.py' program;
* Launch the 'warnme.py' program with the '--gui' option;
* Trying to use the 'warnme.py' program in a system without either the POSIX
  'at' or the freedesktop.org 'notify-send' utilities.

You may set an alarm in one of these ways:

* Set alarm to fire in a specified interval in minutes:
  - click "Set alarm in"
  - choose the number of minutes
  - type the desired alarm notification message
  - if you wish, set the recurrence interval of the alarm, in minutes
  - press "Set alarm" button

* Set alarm to fire at specified time:
  - click "Set alarm at"
  - choose the hour and minute
  - type the desired alarm notification message
  - if you wish, set the recurrence interval of the alarm, in minutes
  - press "Set Alarm" button

To remove an alarm, select it on the list of pending alarms and press the
"Remove alarm" button.  You may select several alarms simultaneously.

All notifications will be lost if you close the program.

Command Line Interface
======================

Command line interface (terminal) accepted commands and syntax:

* Set alarm at specified interval in minutes:
  warnme.py --in <minutes> [--text <message>]

* Set alarm at specific time:
  warnme.py --at <hour:minute> [--text <message>]

* For each of the previous commands, you may also set the recurrence of the
  alarms, in minutes:
  warnme.py --in <minutes> [--text <message>] --repeat <minutes>
  warnme.py --at <hour:minute> [--text <message>] --repeat <minutes>

* Show list of alarm IDs and descriptions:
  warnme.py --list
  
* Remove alarm identified by alarm ID:
  warnme.py --delete <alarm ID>

* Start the graphical user interface:
  warnme.py --gui

* Print Help, Warranty, Copyright and version information on the terminal:
  warnme.py --help
  warnme.py --warranty
  warnme.py --copyright
  warnme.py --version
  
* Test notification interface:
  wmnotify.py <message>
